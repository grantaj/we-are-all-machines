We are in the midst of a Copernican crisis in which human intelligence
is being rapidly de-centred by machine intelligence. My paintings
respond by foregrounding both the artist-as-machine, through rules,
optimisations, and mechanistic processes, and the viewer-as-machine,
through perceptual instabilities, optical illusions, and semantic
dissipation.

I engineer hard-edged abstract oil paintings in which colour shift
phenomena operate as an attack on the human visual system, exposing
its mechanistic basis. Repeated, redacted and obfuscated obscenity
hovers between legibility and abstraction, producing semantic drain to
the point of new emergent meaning.

Perceptual instabilities reflect on the challenges of discourse in a
post-truth society. These paintings do not offer certainty. Rather,
they reveal the fragility of truth and perception, and the
possibilities that emerge when modes of knowing collapse.

My work embodies the current Copernican crisis: denying the viewer
their accustomed position of perceptual dominance and reminding us
that we are all machines.
